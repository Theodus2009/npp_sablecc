Notepad++ User Define Language (UDL) for SableCC grammar definitions

This repo is purely to share the UDL I created to aid with [SableCC](http://www.sablecc.org/) v3 grammar creation. If you have any updates to make, feel free to fork, improve and send a pull request back.
I use the Black board theme, so this UDL is designed to fit in with its style. Please feel free to contribute variants for other Npp themes.

Enjoy :)
